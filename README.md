# Bioacoustics Cookbook
This repository contains various "recipes" for bioacoustics workflows and problems. These recipes include tutorials, discussions, and demonstrations, often relying on our open-source bioacoustics package [opensoundscape](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape). They are written as Juptyer Notebooks to facilitate the integration of text, visuals, and code. 

## Top-down listening
- reviewing and annotating audio clips based on classifier scores and metadata

## Data selection
- calculate sunrise and sunset times at a set of coordinate locations across a range of dates with `sunset_sunrise_calculator.ipynb`
- filter a set of AudioMoth files to include only specific date ranges and (start) time ranges with `filter_files_by_dates_and_times.ipynb`
