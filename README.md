# Bioacoustics Cookbook
This repository contains various "recipes" for bioacoustics workflows and problems. These recipes include tutorials, discussions, and demonstrations, often relying on our open-source bioacoustics package [opensoundscape](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape). They are written as Juptyer Notebooks to facilitate the integration of text, visuals, and code.
